# Evidently AI is a powerful open-source tool for monitoring and analyzing the performance of machine learning models in production. It provides various functionalities to track and manage the health of your models over time, particularly focusing on aspects like data drift, model performance degradation, and fairness. Here's how you can use Evidently AI in an ML project:

# 1. Data Drift Detection
# Purpose: Data drift occurs when the statistical properties of the input data change over time, which can lead to model performance degradation. Evidently AI can automatically detect data drift.
# How to Use:
# Compare distributions of the training data against the current production data.
# Use Evidently’s data drift report to visualize and quantify changes in data distributions.
# Example:
# python
# Copy code
# from evidently.dashboard import Dashboard
# from evidently.dashboard.tabs import DataDriftTab

# # Create a data drift dashboard
# data_drift_dashboard = Dashboard(tabs=[DataDriftTab()])
# data_drift_dashboard.calculate(train_data, production_data)
# data_drift_dashboard.show()
# 2. Model Performance Monitoring
# Purpose: Monitoring your model’s performance metrics over time ensures that it continues to perform well in production. Evidently AI can track metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
# How to Use:
# Compare the model's performance metrics on training data versus production data.
# Generate performance reports and dashboards.
# Example:
# python
# Copy code
# from evidently.dashboard import Dashboard
# from evidently.dashboard.tabs import ClassificationPerformanceTab

# # Create a performance monitoring dashboard
# performance_dashboard = Dashboard(tabs=[ClassificationPerformanceTab()])
# performance_dashboard.calculate(reference_data, current_data)
# performance_dashboard.show()
# 3. Fairness Monitoring
# Purpose: Ensure that your model is fair and does not introduce bias against certain groups. Evidently AI can help detect and monitor bias in your model predictions.
# How to Use:
# Use Evidently's fairness report to evaluate the model across different subgroups.
# Monitor fairness metrics like disparate impact, demographic parity, etc.
# Example:
# python
# Copy code
# from evidently.dashboard import Dashboard
# from evidently.dashboard.tabs import FairnessTab

# # Create a fairness monitoring dashboard
# fairness_dashboard = Dashboard(tabs=[FairnessTab()])
# fairness_dashboard.calculate(reference_data, current_data, column_mapping=fairness_mapping)
# fairness_dashboard.show()
# 4. Custom Dashboards and Reports
# Purpose: Create custom dashboards to monitor specific aspects of your ML model and data pipeline.
# How to Use:
# Combine multiple tabs (data drift, performance, fairness) to create comprehensive monitoring dashboards.
# Customize reports to focus on the metrics and visualizations most relevant to your use case.
# 5. Integration with MLOps Pipelines
# Purpose: Integrate Evidently AI into your continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automated monitoring and alerts.
# How to Use:
# Set up regular checks to detect issues in the data pipeline or model performance.
# Generate alerts or reports based on the Evidently AI monitoring outputs.
# Example:
# python
# Copy code
# from evidently import ColumnMapping
# from evidently.report import Report

# report = Report(tabs=[DataDriftTab(), ClassificationPerformanceTab()])
# report.run(reference_data=train_data, current_data=production_data, column_mapping=ColumnMapping())
# report.save_html("report.html")
# 6. Scenario-Specific Monitoring
# Data Quality Issues: Track issues like missing values, outliers, or inconsistent data types.
# Model Degradation: Identify if your model's predictions are becoming less reliable over time.
